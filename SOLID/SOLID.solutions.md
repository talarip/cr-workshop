## SOLID

**SOLID** is the mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers for the first five principles named by Robert Martin, which meant five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design.

 * [S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](#single-responsibility-principle-srp)
 * [O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](#openclosed-principle-ocp)
 * [L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](#liskov-substitution-principle-lsp)
 * [I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](#interface-segregation-principle-isp)
 * [D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](#dependency-inversion-principle-dip)

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

As stated in Clean Code, "There should never be more than one reason for a class
to change". It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like
when you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is
that your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons
to change. Minimizing the amount of times you need to change a class is important.
It's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify a piece of it,
it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other dependent modules in
your codebase.

```php
class UserAuth 
{
    private $user;

    public function __construct(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }
    
    public function verifyCredentials(): bool
    {
        // ...
    }
}

class UserSettings 
{
    private $user;
    private $auth;

    public function __construct(User $user) 
    {
        $this->user = $user;
        $this->auth = new UserAuth($user);
    }

    public function changeSettings(array $settings): void
    {
        if ($this->auth->verifyCredentials()) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

As stated by Bertrand Meyer, "software entities (classes, modules, functions,
etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification." What does that
mean though? This principle basically states that you should allow users to
add new functionalities without changing existing code.


```php
interface Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise;
}

class AjaxAdapter implements Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class NodeAdapter implements Adapter
{
    public function request(string $url): Promise
    {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class HttpRequester
{
    private $adapter;

    public function __construct(Adapter $adapter)
    {
        $this->adapter = $adapter;
    }

    public function fetch(string $url): Promise
    {
        return $this->adapter->request($url);
    }
}
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

This is a scary term for a very simple concept. It's formally defined as "If S
is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any
of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed,
etc.)." That's an even scarier definition.

The best explanation for this is if you have a parent class and a child class,
then the base class and child class can be used interchangeably without getting
incorrect results. This might still be confusing, so let's take a look at the
classic Square-Rectangle example. Mathematically, a square is a rectangle, but
if you model it using the "is-a" relationship via inheritance, you quickly
get into trouble.

Solution:

The best way is separate the quadrangles and allocation of a more general subtype for both shapes.

Despite the apparent similarity of the square and the rectangle, they are different.
A square has much in common with a rhombus, and a rectangle with a parallelogram, but they are not subtype.
A square, a rectangle, a rhombus and a parallelogram are separate shapes with their own properties, albeit similar.

```php
interface Shape
{
    public function getArea(): int;
}

class Rectangle implements Shape
{
    private $width = 0;
    private $height = 0;

    public function __construct(int $width, int $height)
    {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

class Square implements Shape
{
    private $length = 0;

    public function __construct(int $length)
    {
        $this->length = $length;
    }

    public function getArea(): int
    {
        return $this->length ** 2;
    }
}

function printArea(Shape $shape): void
{
    echo sprintf('%s has area %d.', get_class($shape), $shape->getArea()).PHP_EOL;
}

$shapes = [new Rectangle(4, 5), new Square(5)];

foreach ($shapes as $shape) {
    printArea($shape);
}
```

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

ISP states that "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
they do not use." 

A good example to look at that demonstrates this principle is for
classes that require large settings objects. Not requiring clients to set up
huge amounts of options is beneficial, because most of the time they won't need
all of the settings. Making them optional helps prevent having a "fat interface".

Solution:
Not every worker is an employee, but every employee is a worker.

```php
interface Workable
{
    public function work(): void;
}

interface Feedable
{
    public function eat(): void;
}

interface Employee extends Feedable, Workable
{
}

class HumanEmployee implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }

    public function eat(): void
    {
        //.... eating in lunch break
    }
}

// robot can only work
class RobotEmployee implements Workable
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}
```

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This principle states two essential things:
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on
abstractions.

This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with PHP frameworks (like Symfony), you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency
Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level
modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.
It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces
the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because
it makes your code hard to refactor.


```php
interface Employee
{
    public function work(): void;
}

class Human implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        // ....working
    }
}

class Robot implements Employee
{
    public function work(): void
    {
        //.... working much more
    }
}

class Manager
{
    private $employee;

    public function __construct(Employee $employee)
    {
        $this->employee = $employee;
    }

    public function manage(): void
    {
        $this->employee->work();
    }
}
```
